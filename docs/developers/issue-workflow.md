## Submitting an Issue

If you encounter a problem or find a **Bug** while using java-tron, we welcome you to submit an Issue Please follow these rules to ensure efficient processing:

### 1. Search Existing Issues

Before submitting a new **Issue**, be sure to check whether someone has already reported the same problem or proposed a similar idea. This will not only help you find a solution faster but also prevent duplicate submissions.

### 2. Choose and Submit an Issue Type

Please select the corresponding **Issue** type based on the problem you are reporting and fill out the **Issue** content according to the template requirements:

* **`Ask a question`**
  Please describe the problem you are experiencing, the expected outcome, and the actual observed result in detail. A clear description helps community members better understand your problem and provide a solution faster.
* **`Report a bug`**
  In addition to describing the problem, expected outcome, and actual result, you should also detail the steps to reproduce the **Bug** and include the java-tron log and `stack trace` from when the problem occurred.
* **`Request a feature`**
  Please explain why this feature is needed, its specific use case, the suggested implementation plan, and whether you are willing to participate in implementing it.


## Issue Handling Process

The process for handling an Issue is as follows:

1. **Tagging Issues**
   New issues will be triaged and labeled by core contributors.
2. **Assigning Issues**
   Issues will be assigned to one or more core community developers. These core developers will participate in the investigation and discussion of the Issue
3. **Community Discussion**
   All community participants can join the Issue investigation and discussion, posting their thoughts or opinions in the comments section. Through the collective wisdom of the community, we will work together to find solutions to problems.
4. **Closing Issues**
   An Issue submitter can close their own submitted Issue at any time. We will also close an Issue when the problem has been resolved, or if the Issue has not been discussed by the community for an extended period. If needed, the Issue submitter or other users can reopen the Issue based on the actual situation.
